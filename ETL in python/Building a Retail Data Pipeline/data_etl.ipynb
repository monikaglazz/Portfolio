Just like others, they have been expanding their e-commerce part of the business. By the end of 2022, e-commerce represented a roaring $80 billion in sales, which is 13% of total sales of Walmart. One of the main factors that affects their sales is public holidays, like the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. \n","\n","This project will contain creating a data pipeline for the analysis of demand and supply around the holidays and running preliminary analysis of the data.
